# CS 465 Final

## Architecture
### Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
- HTML will always be the classic form of development and as far as I am concerned it is the best for being able to understand what is happening. 
- Express is rather clunky to adjust to and without proper CSS you'll be left with a lackluster visual product given my choice between the systems that we worked with during this project I would choose to use Angular every time.
- JavaScript took me some time to get used to but I began to enjoy working with it. I feel that I will become much more inclined to work with this language in the future.
### Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
- In MongoDB's own words "NoSQL databases were created in response to the limitations of traditional relational database technology. When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are often more scalable and provide superior performance." It provides a free scalable environment for you to work in for test cases like this project.

## Functionality
### How is JSON different from JavaScript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

### Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

## Testing
### Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The method is how you do anything in full stack say you want to find something in your database youâ€™ll need to run a GET method. Do you want to create a new entry you will need to use a PUT method, when registering new users for your site you will be using a POST method. The most strait forward of all the methods is the DELETE method which is used to remove entries.

## Reflection
### How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
- It taught me a lot about perseverance even in the face of wanting to break down and quit when the instructions are unclear and improperly documented. It showed that I can be resourceful and find answers to questions that are not always the easiest to find.
